= NIST publication identifiers

== Purpose

NIST publications are numbered according to an identification scheme.

This gem implements a mechanism to parse and utilize NIST publication identifers
provided in the https://github.com/usnistgov/NIST-Tech-Pubs[NIST-Tech-Pubs]
repository.

== Historic identifier patterns

There are at least three major "pattern series" of identifiers due to historical
reasons:

* NIST publications produced by the PubID scheme (202X-)
* NIST publications produced prior to the PubID scheme (1988-)
* NBS publications, produced under the National Bureau of Standards (the
  previous name of NIST, 1901 to 1988)

This implementation attempts to support all three types of publication
identifier patterns.

== NIST PubID

NIST is currently developing a unified publication identifier scheme ("PubID")
for their technical series of publications, which allows machine-readable
identifier parts.

This scheme is described in "`Publication Identifier Syntax for NIST Technical
Series Publications`" authored by
https://www.nist.gov/people/james-foti[Jim Foti]
of the https://www.nist.gov/itl/csd[CSD, ITL], and
https://www.nist.gov/people/kathryn-miller[Kathryn Miller] and
https://www.nist.gov/people/kate-bucher[Kate Bucher] of the
https://www.nist.gov/associate-director-management-resources/staff-offices/information-services-office[ISO],
Management Resources.

NOTE: This scheme is still at proposal stage.

This gem implements the NIST PubID scheme and allows the conversion to and from
historic patterns.


== Use cases to support

PubID:

. Given a PubID (full-form title, abbreviated-form title, short-form title),
  generate the corresponding machine-readable (MR) PubID format
. Given a MR PubID:
.. generate the full-form title
.. generate the abbreviated-form title
.. generate short-form title
.. generate the DOI (which is just DOI ID + MR)

Historic compatibility:

. Parse a historic publication identifier into its components:
.. output the original publication identifier (i.e. store the contents in the
  object)
.. output a MR PubID

. Parse a historic DOI into a PubID:
.. output the original DOI (i.e. store the contents in the object)
.. output a MR PubID

== Publication identifier patterns

=== 1 "Full-form" title

Samples:

* National Institute of Standards and Technology Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 199
* National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-27, Revision A
* National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-39 (Second Public Draft)

(originally described in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-nist/issues/98)

=== 2 “Abbreviated form” title

This form is used in the Authority section.

----
Natl. Inst. Stand. Technol. {abbrev(series)} {docnumber} {part | abbrev(volume)}, {abbrev(revision)}
----

* `abbrev(series)` represent the abbreviation of the Series title
* (Note: there is no `{update-date}`)
* Abbreviate “Revision” to “Rev.” and “Volume” to “Vol.”

Examples:

* "Natl. Inst. Stand. Technol. Spec. Publ. 800-78-4"
* "Natl. Inst. Stand. Technol. Spec. Publ. 800-116”
* "Natl. Inst. Stand. Technol. Spec. Publ. 800-57 Part 1, Revision 4”

(originally from https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-nist/issues/88)

=== 3 "Short form" title

The “short form” is used to cite the documents within text.

It is used in these situations:

1. Locality references. “In Section 3.2 of SP 800-187…” (the "SP 800-187” is a link).
+
NOTE: NIST pubs are composed of "Sections" not "Clauses"

2. A generic document reference. “SP 800-53 describes…”. This form does not specify a revision or update date.

3. “All parts”. “The SP 800-57 subseries describes key management…”.

"NISTIR 6885 2003 Edition (February 2003)” is a poor indicator.

The correct rule should be:

* SP:
+
----
NIST {abbrev(series)} {docnumber } {edition, optional}
----

* FIPS:
+
----
FIPS {docnumber }
----
+
NOTE: `docnumber` is the full FIPS number, including revision, e.g., `140-2`.

(originally from https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-nist/issues/88)

=== 4 Machine-readable form

The machine-readable form is:

----
NIST.{series}.{docnumber}.{part|volume}.{revision}.{update-date}
----

Generally, this rule should be able to uniquely identify an edition of a document.

Where:

----
series = SP, IR, FIPS, TN [“Technical Note”], HB [“Handbook”], CSWP [“Cybersecurity White Paper”]
----

Details:
* Various scenarios for “part”:
** “Part 1” use “pt1”;
** When a letter part is indicated, “800-63A” we should keep it as part of the docnumber (i.e., don’t indicate “pt”)

* Volumes: use “v1”

* Revision typically: “Revision 1” use “r1”

* If a superseding edition is a full revision, it will get the next Rev. #.
* If a superseding edition is just an errata update, we can use the update date
from the title page (“includes updates as of…”) to uniquely identify this
edition. Preferably use `-yyyymmdd` format.

Some examples:
* `NIST.SP.800-53r4-20152201` supersedes `NIST.SP.800-53r4-20140115`
* `NIST.SP.800-63A-20171201` supersedes `NIST.SP.800-63A`
* `NIST.SP.800-57pt1r4` supersedes `NIST.SP.800-57pt1r3`
* `NIST.SP.800-160v1` supersedes `NIST.SP.800-160-20180103`
* Undated form `NIST.SP.800-53r4`
