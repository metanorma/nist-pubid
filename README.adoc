= NIST publication identifiers ("NIST PubID")

== Purpose

NIST publications are numbered according to an identification scheme.

This gem implements a mechanism to parse and utilize NIST publication identifers
provided in the https://github.com/usnistgov/NIST-Tech-Pubs[NIST-Tech-Pubs]
repository.

== Historic identifier patterns

There are at least three major "pattern series" of identifiers due to historical
reasons:

* NIST publications produced by the PubID scheme (202X-)
* NIST publications produced prior to the PubID scheme (1988-)
* NBS publications, produced under the National Bureau of Standards (the
  previous name of NIST, 1901 to 1988)

This implementation attempts to support all three types of publication
identifier patterns.

== NIST PubID

NIST is currently developing a unified publication identifier scheme ("PubID")
for their technical series of publications, which allows machine-readable
identifier parts.

This scheme is described in "`Publication Identifier Syntax for NIST Technical
Series Publications`" authored by
https://www.nist.gov/people/james-foti[Jim Foti]
of the https://www.nist.gov/itl/csd[CSD, ITL], and
https://www.nist.gov/people/kathryn-miller[Kathryn Miller] and
https://www.nist.gov/people/kate-bucher[Kate Bucher] of the
https://www.nist.gov/associate-director-management-resources/staff-offices/information-services-office[ISO],
Management Resources.

NOTE: This scheme is still at proposal stage.

This gem implements the NIST PubID scheme and allows the conversion to and from
historic patterns.


== Use cases to support

PubID:

. Given a PubID (full-form title, abbreviated-form title, short-form title),
  generate the corresponding machine-readable (MR) PubID format
. Given a MR PubID:
.. generate the full-form title
.. generate the abbreviated-form title
.. generate short-form title
.. generate the DOI (which is just DOI ID + MR)

Historic compatibility:

. Parse a historic publication identifier into its components:
.. output the original publication identifier (i.e. store the contents in the
  object)
.. output a MR PubID

. Parse a historic DOI into a PubID:
.. output the original DOI (i.e. store the contents in the object)
.. output a MR PubID

|===

=== Stage

The stage code element only applies to non-final publications.

In most series, documents are only released as final publications, and therefore
their PubIDs will not contain a stage code.

Only some series support stage codes, e.g. SP 800 and SP 1800.

|===
| Name | Value

| Initial Public Draft | IPD
| Second Public Draft (to the Nth Public Draft) | 2PD (... nPD)
| Final Public Draft | FPD
| Work-in-Progress Draft | WD
| Preliminary Draft | PreD

|===

=== Report number

The contents and pattern of the report number are dependent on the series.

Possible values:

* {sequence number}
* {subseries}-{sequence number}
* {sequence number}-{volume}
* {sequence number}-{edition}
* {subseries}-{sequence number}-{edition}
* etc.

A "Part" can also be indicated by an appended alphabetic character to the end.

=== Part

|===
| Name | Abbrev and Short | MR

| Part | Pt. | `pt`
| Volume | Vol. | `v`
| Section | Sec. | `sec`
| Supplement | Suppl. | `sup`
| Index | Index | `indx`
| Addendum | Add. | `add` (TBD with NIST)
| Insert | Ins. | `ins` (TBC with NIST)
| Errata | Err. | `err` (TBC with NIST)

|===

=== Edition

|===
| Name | Abbrev and Short | MR

| Revision | Rev. | `r`
| Edition | Ed. | `e`
| Version | Ver. | `ver`

|===

=== Translation

An ISO 639-2 code that represents a translated document from English.

If a document is translated from English, suffix the document with a 3-letter
ISO 639-2 code within parentheses.

Raw values seen in legacy DOIs include:

|===
| Name | Correct value | MR | Legacy values seen in DOI

| Spanish | (ESP) | `esp` | `es`
| Vietnamese | (VIE) | `vie` | `viet`
| Portuguese | (POR) | `por` | `port`
| Chinese | (ZHO) | `zho` | `chi`

|===

=== Update

==== General

When a document is updated with an errata, the original edition may be reissued
to include the errata.

These documents will display the text "includes updates as of...".

In this case the document identifier will include the element "Update".

|===
| Name | Abbrev and Short | MR

| Update | Upd. | `u`

|===

NOTE: This is similar to the ISO/IEC "Amd." and "Cor." except that the NIST
"Upd." is applied to the original document and (typically) does not exist
separately.

==== Update number

A sequential integer numbering of the update counting from the original document.

The first update is numbered 1, and so forth.

==== Update year

The year last updated, shown as a suffix to the identifier.

* "{identifier}:{update-year}"


== PubID patterns

=== Presentation

Generally in this order:

* No update: `{series} {stage} {report number}{part}{edition}({translation})`
* With update: `{series} {stage} {report number}{part}{edition}({translation})/{update} {update number}:{update year}`


=== Full PubID

Samples:

* National Institute of Standards and Technology Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 199
* National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-27, Revision A
* National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-39 (Second Public Draft)

(originally described in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-nist/issues/98)

=== Abbreviated PubID

This form is used in the Authority section.

----
Natl. Inst. Stand. Technol. {abbrev(series)} {docnumber} {part | abbrev(volume)}, {abbrev(revision)}
----

* `abbrev(series)` represent the abbreviation of the Series title
* (Note: there is no `{update-date}`)

Examples:

* "Natl. Inst. Stand. Technol. Spec. Publ. 800-78-4"
* "Natl. Inst. Stand. Technol. Spec. Publ. 800-116”
* "Natl. Inst. Stand. Technol. Spec. Publ. 800-57 Part 1, Revision 4”


(originally from https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-nist/issues/88)

=== Short PubID

The “short form” is used to cite the documents within text.

It is used in these situations:

1. Locality references. “In Section 3.2 of SP 800-187…” (the "SP 800-187” is a link).
+
NOTE: NIST pubs are composed of "Sections" not "Clauses"

2. A generic document reference. “SP 800-53 describes…”. This form does not specify a revision or update date.

3. “All parts”. “The SP 800-57 subseries describes key management…”.

"NISTIR 6885 2003 Edition (February 2003)” is a poor indicator.

The correct rule should be:

----
{abbrev(series)} {docnumber} {abbrev(volume)} {abbrev(revision)} {edition, optional}
----

NOTE: For FIPS, `docnumber` is the full FIPS number, including revision, e.g.,
`140-2`.

(originally from https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-nist/issues/88)

Short form date:

* `Month YYYY`

Examples:

* NIST SP 800-53r4 (20152201) supersedes NIST SP 800-53r4 (20140115)
* NIST SP 800 63A (December 2017) supersedes NIST SP 800-63A
* NIST SP 800 57 Part 1 Revision 4 supersedes NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Revision 3 ("Rev." is also accepted, and converted to "Revision")
* NIST SP 800 160 Volume 1 supersedes NIST SP 800-160 (20180103) ("Vol." is also accepted, and converted to "Volume")
* Undated form "NIST SP 800 53r4"

Strip Revision and Date from title, only if the Revision and Date are unique for
each document number. These are identified as "Rev. ...", "Revision ...." and "
(Month YYYY)", whichever comes first.


=== Machine-readable PubID

The machine-readable form is:

----
{publisher}.{series}.{docnumber}.{part|volume}.{revision}.{update-date}
----

Generally, this rule should be able to uniquely identify an edition of a document.

Where:

----
series = SP, IR, FIPS, TN [“Technical Note”], HB [“Handbook”], CSWP [“Cybersecurity White Paper”]
----

Details:
* Various scenarios for “part”:
** “Part 1” use “pt1”;
** When a letter part is indicated, “800-63A” we should keep it as part of the docnumber (i.e., don’t indicate “pt”)

* Volumes: use “v1”

* Revision typically: “Revision 1” use “r1”

* If a superseding edition is a full revision, it will get the next Rev. #.
* If a superseding edition is just an errata update, we can use the update date
from the title page (“includes updates as of…”) to uniquely identify this
edition. Preferably use `-yyyymmdd` format.

Some examples:

* `NIST.SP.800-53r4-20152201` supersedes `NIST.SP.800-53r4-20140115`
* `NIST.SP.800-63A-20171201` supersedes `NIST.SP.800-63A`
* `NIST.SP.800-57pt1r4` supersedes `NIST.SP.800-57pt1r3`
* `NIST.SP.800-160v1` supersedes `NIST.SP.800-160-20180103`
* Undated form `NIST.SP.800-53r4`

(originally from https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-nist/issues/88)

== Addendum

NIST SP 800-38A has an Addendum.

In NIST MR let's call this part add-X, e.g. "NIST SP 800-38A Addendum" =>
`NIST.SP.800-38A.pt-A.add-1`

. Full form title: "Addendum to {publisher} {series} {docnumber} {part | volume}, {edition}"

. Abbreviated form title: "Add. to {abbrev(publisher)} {abbrev(series)} {docnumber} {part | abbrev(volume)}, {abbrev(edition)}"

. Short form title: "{short(series)} {docnumber} {part | abbrev(volume)}, {abbrev(edition)} Addendum"

. Machine-readable form NIST.SP.800-38A.pt-A.add-1
